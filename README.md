•	Analyzed the best layout strategies for electronic circuit boards under different constraints. 
•	Led the team to design a single-objective planning model based on the idea of 0-1 planning, where the greedy algorithm was used to find an approximate solution, with the model being further tested in six different situations.
•	Summarized the research process in a 20-page report and won the second prize among over 300 teams (rank 15/300+).

The Development of Music and Its Interaction with the Social Environment                               Suzhou, China
Sponsor: Interdisciplinary Contest in Modelling, The Consortium for Mathematics and Its Application, USA             02/2021
•	Analyzed the interplay among different music genres and studied the music & socio-environment interactions.
•	Constructed a ranking model based on the PageRank algorithm to assess the interacting influences among different music genres; assessed the similarities among various music types by using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and SA-improved K-means Clustering; denoised the given times series data via FTTO algorithm to study the music development.
•	Finished a 25-page report, becoming a finalist winner (top 2% out of 26112 teams).
